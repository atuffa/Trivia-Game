Trivia- game project 1

-----------
Project game built by JQuery and JavaScript

This game project will help students or anyone new or familiar with JQuery and JavaScript. 

It's a question game where the player has five questions to answer.

The player is supposed to answer all questions in 20 seconds. If not, the game will stop automatically and displays the number of questions answered, missed and unanswered. 

If the player answers the questions before 20 seconds he can click the done button and the result will be displayed.

It is useful to understand or use as a reference for the concept of 
            - DOM manipulation 
            - Binding an events to multiple classes,elements, id and etc...
            - Scope 
            - Objects
            - Arrays
            
I recommend you to look at the HTML before jumping into either jQuery or CSS

I have tried to give a comment on all the jquery functions and variables which I hope will help you understand the code easily.
